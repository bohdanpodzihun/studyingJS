# studyingJS
Repository of simple projects that I liked the most during my studies js

1) Button More
 This small project about opening the text which is not displayed completely. JS is optimized if there are any number of such text boxes
2) Find treasure
 This project is a little game, where user can try to find treasure on the map
3) For in
 This one shows output only in console. Here is example of using "for in" by sorting through an array of movies
4) Guess The Word
 Also a little game. Here is random word that y can try to guess by finding letters of this word
